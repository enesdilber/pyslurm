# pyslurm

Use this to call slurm functions from python. The Slurm object has the functions that I usually use in my projects. This thing only tested on umich great-lakes. <br>
See [Demo.ipynb](Demo) file for the simple usage. <br>
See [https://pypi.org/project/simple-slurm/](simple-slurm) for more generic Python wrapper for Slurm.

# pyslurm

Use this to call slurm functions from python. The Slurm object has the functions that I usually use in my projects. This thing only tested on umich great-lakes. <br>
See [Demo](Demo.ipynb) file for the simple usage. <br>
See [simple-slurm](https://pypi.org/project/simple-slurm/) for a more generic Python wrapper for Slurm.
